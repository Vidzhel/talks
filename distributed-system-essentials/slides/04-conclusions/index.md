## Conclusions

>I don't pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about.

Arthur C. Clarke

Notes:
- this talk, as entities in DDD, just projection of material
- distributed system isn't that eas 
- both, monolith and mc services - to satisfy business
  - technical goals vary a lot
- in microservices - agility attracts enterprises
- monolith - speed of development
  - while tend to loose structure
- not to jump bandwagon of micserv, without a reason

Notes:
- overview, for dipper insights, those books will probably help
